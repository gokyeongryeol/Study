# Study materials on notes, seminars, and surveys

## Notes




## Seminar

Presentation files for regular lab seminar about recent deep learning research accepted in top-tier conference in aritificial intelligence (e.g. ICML, NeurIPs, ICLR).
Papers are selected based on the following research interset:

 - Generative Models
 - Variational Inference
 - Meta-learning
 - Reinforcement learning

## Survey

Survey on basic (and advanced) deep learning modules which many follow-up studies regard as baselines.
In macroscopic view, these can be categorized into

 - Regularization
 - Convolutional Neural Network
 - Recurrent Neural Network
 - Autoencoder
 - Meta-learning
